        /* More Scanner info:
        To create an object of Scanner class, we usually pass the predefined 
            object System.in, which represents the standard input stream. 
            We may pass an object of class File if we want to read input 
            from a file.
        To read numerical values of a certain data type XYZ, the function to 
            use is nextXYZ(). For example, to read a value of type short, we 
            can use nextShort()
        To read strings, we use nextLine().
        To read a single character, we use next().charAt(0). next() function 
            returns the next token/word in the input as a string and charAt(0) 
            funtion returns the first character in that string.
        */
  
        // Character input 
        System.out.print("Enter a character (letter): ");
        char letter = cin.next().charAt(0); 

        System.out.println("Input charactyer: "+letter);  
        
        
        /* 
        Sometimes, we have to check if the next value we read is of a 
            certain type or if the input has ended (EOF marker encountered).
        
        Then, we check if the scannerâ€™s input is of the type we want with the 
            help of hasNextXYZ() functions where XYZ is the type we are 
            interested in. The function returns true if the scanner has a 
            token of that type, otherwise false. For example, in the above 
            code, we have used hasNextInt().To check for a string, we use 
            hasNextLine(). Similarly, to check for a single character, we 
            use hasNext().charAt(0).
        
        Let us look at the code snippet to read some numbers from console and 
            print their mean.
